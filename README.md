## SaltBlock Challenge

Salt Block Catering (http://saltblockhospitality.com/) came to life as a “Scratch Made” kitchen and over the past 3 years has grown into what they are today, a locally sourced and thoughtfully crafted full service hospitality group providing catering, venue, and hospitality management.
SaltBlock’s client facing reps spend over 70% of their time vetting clients. Clients, who often don’t know exactly what they want for their event, expect a personalized, high touch relationship with their hospitality company. This translates into the SaltBlock team spending countless hours gathering information, educating clients on their options, guiding them through menu’s, creating proposals, and then adjusting these proposals all while bouncing from event to event. After this entire process, there is still a chance these potential clients could back out after seeing the proposal.
Your challenge is to build a solution that creates an engaging, brand-conscious experience for prospective clients that also saves the SaltBlock team time at the top of their sales funnel.
